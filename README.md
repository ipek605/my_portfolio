# React Portfolio

My personal portfolio built using React and SCSS. I'm continually adding projects, modifying content, and updating the look and functionality. 

Please check out my work at https://gleaming-faun-52fd90.netlify.app

## Prerequisites

If you want to pull inspiration from my portfolio design, please email or credit me :) But if you're interested in how I built it, below are the tools used:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
* And some SCSS!


## Installation

To build a similar, single page portfolio or website for yourself, you'll want first create a new React app:
```
npx create-react-app <projectname>

You can also fork and clone this repo to use as a template and then just run npm install

## Usage

You'll be able to run the app locally by running npm start:
```
npm start
```
All your changes should update the local host in real time.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Questions

Questions or feedback-- we welcome them all! Feel free to reach out for any questions about the repo, open an issue or contact me and I'll get back to you soon!
